# Incubator





Microorganisms growth are influenced by several factors including temperature. The type of microorganism you are growing requires that you use the right temperature to achieve optimal growth. Microorganisms like fungi grow best at 25 degree celcius. On the other hand, bacteria, depending on which type you are growing will also require it's unique growing conditions and temperature. Escherichia coli, a model bacteria used for several life sciences experiment grows best at 37 degree celcius. Incubators are temperature controled chambers for growing microorganisms. However, incubators are often very expensive to buy in resource limited labs due to their expensive nature. Our goal on this project is to build a viarable temperature incubator using DIY methods and equipment and making it very easy for DIY Bio or community labs that are resource constraint to equally build their own incubator.
